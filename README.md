# Medical mask detection and classification
Medical Mask Detection and Classification with MTCNN tensorflow 

This code detects humans' faces and classifies it to one of 3 classes: 
  - Correct - person is wearing mask correctly
  - No mask - person does not wear a mask
  - Wrong mask - person wears the mask, but it is done wrong

To run the code:
  - python test_model.py 'im dir'
  - for example: python test_model.py ./test2.jpg
